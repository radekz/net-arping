Net/Arping version 0.03
=======================

The module contains function for testing remote host reachability
by sending ARP packets. The program must be run as root or be setuid
to root.


I used this module on linux boxes (with ALT Linux Master,
KSI LInux Manticore), also I tested the module on FreeBSD 4.6
- everything works fine.

It would be very great if somebody tried to use the module on
other OSes and reported me about the results and bugs.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the following libraries:

- libnet: http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/ (1.1 or later required)
- pcap:   http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest

INSTALLATION

If your pcap (or libnet) header files are installed somewhere
strange, create the Makefile using the INC and/or LIBS option.
Something like this

# perl Makefile.PL INC="-I/somewhere/far/pcap -I/somewhere/far/libnet"

To compile the Arping.xs and to install this module type as usual:

  make
  sudo make test
  sudo make install
