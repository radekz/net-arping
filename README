Net/Arping version 0.03
=======================

The module contains function for testing remote host reachability
by sending ARP packets. The program must be run as root or be setuid
to root.

For compiling the module you need the following libraries:

- libnet: http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/dist/libnet.tar.gz
- pcap:   http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest


I used this module on linux boxes (with ALT Linux Master, 
KSI LInux Manticore), also I tested the module on FreeBSD 4.6 
- everything works fine.

It would be very great if somebody tried to use the module on 
other OSes and reported me about the results and bugs.
 
INSTALLATION

If your pcap (or libnet) header files are installed somewhere 
strange, create the Makefile using the INC and/or LIBS option.
Something like this                                      
                                                                                
# perl Makefile.PL INC="-I/somewhere/far/pcap -I/somewhere/far/libnet"
			 

To compile the Arping.xs and to install this module type as usual:

# make
# make test
# make install
